<h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
  
  <p>We will be giving away £200 to spend at TOAST.</p>

<p>1. To enter the Promotion, you will need to have a product review published on www.toa.st. Each product review that is published gives one entry into the Promotion. Only one review will be accepted per person for each product purchased. The submission of a product review is subject to our Customer Ratings and Reviews Terms of Use, a copy of which can be found on the review submission form. Access to the internet and a valid email address are required to enter.</p>​

<p>2. The Promotion will run from 00.01 GMT on 13 October 2017 to 11.59pm on 31 October 2017 (“Closing Date”). Entries received after the Closing Date or received by any other means (e.g. in the post) will not be accepted.</p>​

<p>3. The winning prize will be £200 to spend at TOAST (“the Prize”). This will be issued as a gift card to spend in a TOAST Shop or as a purchase credit to be used via TOAST Customer Services.</p>​

<p>4. The Promotion is open to all UK residents over the age of 18 excluding: (i) employees of the Promoter and their families; (ii) the employees of companies or organisations with whom the Promotion is run and their families; and (iii) agents or any other person directly connected with the Promotion.</p>​

<p>5. Only one entry, fulfilling the eligibility requirements, will be accepted per person per product purchased. Spammers will be disqualified.</p>​

<p>6. Entries in the incorrect format will not be considered. Once entered, entries cannot be returned / withdrawn.</p>​

<p>7. The winner of the Promotion will be selected in a random draw conducted by the Toast’s marketing department, from all valid entries received by the Closing Time for the relevant day, and to be conducted by no later than 10 November 2017.</p>​

<p>8. Winners will be notified by telephone or email within 24 hours of the draw. If the prize winner does not respond to this notification within 5 working days, the Promoter reserves the right to select an alternative prize winner at random from all remaining valid entries, with the originally selected winner forfeiting their right to the prize. The result of the draw is final and no correspondence will be entered into, except with the winners.</p>​

<p>9. The Promoter may require participants to provide proof of identity, proof of age and proof of residency. Identification considered suitable for verification is at Promoter's discretion. The winner may be required to sign a statement proving their eligibility/liability. The Promoter may, in its sole discretion, disqualify any entrant that fails to satisfy the eligibility requirements.</p>​

<p>10. The Promoter’s decision (or that of a third party, where a third party is involved in any decision relating to the Promotion) is final in every situation, including any not covered above and no correspondence will be entered into in respect of the validity of any such decision.</p>​

<p>11. The Promoter reserves the right to exclude late, incomplete or multiple registrations using multiple email addresses. Registrations made by third parties, agents, using methods such as a macro or a script, using automated devices or processes or syndicated entries are not permitted and all such entries will be disqualified and any prize award will be void.</p>​

<p>12. The Promoter does not accept any responsibility for late or lost entries. Proof of sending is not proof of receipt.</p>​

<p>13. The winners' details (name and county only) will be made available 10 working days after the Closing Date and for 4 weeks only by sending a stamped addressed envelope to Marketing, TOAST (MAIL ORDER LIMITED), 3rd Floor, Matrix Beta, Matrix Business Park, Swansea, SA6 8RE indicating the name of the Promotion.</p>​

<p>14. Entry to the Promotion and acceptance of the prize constitutes permission to use any entrant’s name, image and any competition entry photograph, for promotional and/or editorial purposes in any format in print and non-print media without additional consultation. By entering, participants further agree to participate in any reasonable publicity arranged by the Promoter or its agencies in the event of them winning.</p>​

<p>15. The Promoter reserves in all cases the right to replace the stated prizes with other prizes that it considers to be of broadly equivalent value. The Promoter offers no cash alternative for non-cash prizes. Prizes are not refundable or transferable. Prizes must be taken as stated and cannot be deferred. When dates are specified they cannot be altered and by entering date-related Promotions or promotions neither the Promoter, nor any third party, are liable in any way to any winner who cannot attend.</p>​

<p>16. The Promoter reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to amend, suspend or cancel the Promotion or extend the entry period or disqualify any participant at any time for technical, legal or other reasons without giving advance notice.</p>​

<p>17.

<p>18. Participants must not supply false information in their registration or share their account details with others, and no individual should participate under any identity that is not their own.

<p>19.

<p>20. The Promotion materials may contain links to other websites that the Promoter does not own or operate. Entrants should be aware that the Promoter does not control, recommend or endorse these other websites, and is not responsible for their content, products, services or privacy policies.</p>​

<p>21. The Promoter cannot guarantee continuous, uninterrupted or secure access to the Promotion or its website and is not responsible for any disruption to the Promotion or our website due to technical problems or otherwise. The Promoter accepts no responsibility for incomplete, incorrectly submitted, delayed, corrupted or misdirected registrations.</p>​

<p>22. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE PROMOTER BE LIABLE, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF STATUTORY DUTY, OR OTHERWISE, FOR ANY LOSS, DAMAGE OR INJURY ARISING UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROMOTION.</p>​

<p>23. Where the Promoter runs a competition in conjunction with a third party such that the third party is responsible for the selection and/or the provision of prizes then the Promoter shall not be responsible for or have any liability for the provision of such prizes.</p>​

<p>24. All entrants to the Promotion are deemed to have read and accepted these terms (and any linked terms contained or referenced herein) and agree to be bound by them and by the decisions of the Promoter, which are final in all matters relating to the promotion (except where any decision relating to the Promotion has been delegated by the Promoter to a third party, when that third party’s decision will be final).</p>​
