<h3>UK Returns Service</h3>

<p>You may return your purchase (or part of it) for an <strong>exchange or refund within 14 days</strong> of receiving it by sending the item(s) back to us at the address provided on your dispatch note returns label. Please use the returns label supplied in your package, and include your dispatch note marked with the items being returned. This will enable us to scan the bar code on the label and send email confirmation to you that your parcel has been safely received. If, for any reason, you no longer have the returns label, please contact our customer service team on +44 (0)333 400 5200.</p>
