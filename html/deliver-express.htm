<h1>Delivery &amp; Returns</h1>

<h2>UK EXPRESS DELIVERY</h2>  

<p><strong>UK Express delivery costs Â£6.95 per order</strong> - no matter how many parcels we send.</p>

<p>All orders need to be placed before 2.00pm for next working day delivery. Orders placed after this will be delivered within 48 hours. Orders placed on a Friday afternoon, during the weekend or on a Bank Holiday will be processed the following working day.</p>

<p>During our sale period, orders should be placed before midday, Monday to Thursday, to qualify for next day delivery. Orders placed on Thursday after midday or on Friday will be delivered the following Monday.</p>

<p>Deliveries are made by DHL from 9am until 8pm and may require a signature. For this reason, you may like to nominate a secure delivery address where someone is available to sign.</p>

<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong></p> 
<ul>
	<li>Saturdays, Sundays and Bank Holidays are NOT classed as working days by our delivery carriers. For this reason, subject to Bank Holidays, anything ordered on a Thursday afternoon or Friday morning will be delivered on the following Monday, and anything ordered from Friday afternoon up until Monday morning will be delivered on the following Tuesday.</li>
	<li>TOAST cannot accept any liability for any delivery instructions which you give to the delivery company. If, for example, you ask the delivery company to leave your order in a different location to the one given at the time of your order (e.g. in a shed or garage, or with a neighbour), we cannot accept responsibility if you fail to receive the order.</li>
	<li>For your safety and security we do not currently deliver to collection points such as: PO Boxes, Amazon lockers, Collect Plus, and Parcel Motel. If you nominate a collection point as your delivery address, we cannot accept responsibility if you fail to receive the order.</li>
